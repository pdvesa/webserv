# WebServ Project

`WebServ` is a simple web server project designed to handle basic HTTP requests.

## Features
- VERY lightweight web server implementation
- Configurable using a loosely nginx based configuration file

## Prerequisites
- A Linux-based operating system (sorry macOS, we use epoll)

## Installation

Clone the repo and make it 

Example usage:

```bash
./webserv configs/sampleconf
```

Alternatively make your own config file.

Just retain yourself from siegeing CGI, it will be refactored one day.
